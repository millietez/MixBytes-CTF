#### To address the given task, the following algorithm is suggested:

1. Utilize the transfer() function to send 99999999999999999998 minimal units of the DBT token to the targeted contract.
2. Ensure that the attacking External Owned Account (EOA) retains 2 minimal units of the DBT token. Achieve this by executing the approve() function for the address of the targeted contract, specifying the transfer of 2 minimal units of DBT.
3. Invoke the redeem() function twice on the targeted contract, setting the parameters amount to 1 and toRedeem to 99999999999999999998.

After two successive calls to redeem(), the balance of minimal units of the CTKN token in the attacking EOA will be 199999999999999999996. Consequently, the task will be successfully completed and ready for submission.
